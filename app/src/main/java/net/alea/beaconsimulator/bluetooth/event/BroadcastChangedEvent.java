 * Linking Beacon Simulator statically or dynamically with other modules is making      *
 * a combined work based on Beacon Simulator. Thus, the terms and conditions of         *
 * the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.                          *

 * As a special exception, the copyright holders of Beacon Simulator give you           *
 * permission to combine Beacon Simulator program with free software programs           *
 * or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with independent               *
 * modules that communicate with Beacon Simulator solely through the                    *
 * net.alea.beaconsimulator.bluetooth.AdvertiseDataGenerator and the                    *
 * net.alea.beaconsimulator.bluetooth.AdvertiseDataParser interfaces. You may           *
 * copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for             *
 * Beacon Simulator and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided that         *
 * you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL               *
 * requires distribution of source code and provided that you do not modify the         *
 * net.alea.beaconsimulator.bluetooth.AdvertiseDataGenerator and the                    *

 * The intent of this license exception and interface is to allow Bluetooth low energy  *
 * closed or proprietary advertise data packet structures and contents to be sensibly   *
 * kept closed, while ensuring the GPL is applied. This is done by using an interface   *
 * which only purpose is to generate android.bluetooth.le.AdvertiseData objects.        *
 *                                                                                      *
